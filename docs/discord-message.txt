Discord bot analytics highlights

? /team-analytics
• Choose competition (EuroLeague, EuroCup, ESAKE, BCL, etc.) and then the team via autocomplete.
• Uses live 3Steps club stats for ORtg/DRtg, Net Rating, shot profile, and totals.
• Provide a season (e.g., 2025 or euroleague-2026) to pull historical data.

? /player-insight
• Select competition + player (autocomplete). Optional team or season filter.
• Shows shooting splits, usage/assist/turnover% when available, plus on/off ratings.

? /league-insight
• Quick overviews by competition: standings, club stats, or best players via 3Steps feed.
• Accepts a season_id (competitionId) for past seasons.

Tips
- Autocomplete requires the competition to be selected first.
- Season fields accept plain years or competitionIds.
- Under the hood all lists leverage the same normalized data layer.
